First I added the brute force solution and the greedy solution.
Greedy alg:
  At every point you take the closest element
  Slowly move through it.
  Fast, n*n speed
  Quite bad at all of that calculation

naive
  This implementation of the naive solution  not the best. 
  Even the dynamix solution, without the dynamic part is faster (there I can process 2 more)
  The reason why it is implemented in th3e way that it is is so that it can be animated easier
  There is also a million solutions already so there is no need to reinvent the warm temp
  Loops through all permutations
  8 is the max although using the non dynamic version of the dynamix solution would have pushed that to around 10

Dynamic
  One that I have written a few times before as it was an importaint part of the competative programming 
  Similar to the brut solution with the only difference that we knowthat we are at vertex v and we have visited verticies [v_0,...v_k]
  then it does not matter in what order so we can go from fact to exp
  Bitshifting used 
  We can go to about 20 or so, doubling the amount

ANT collonie sim
  Although the logic itself was not hard to implement it became quite quickly clear to me that this alg is a lot more of a by feel alg
  There are (at least in my code) 4 parameters you have to fiddle with to get a result you like and having them off will result in something that is much slower than 
  actual greedy algs
  But if the parameters are fine tooned for the problem (that is dependant on th3e amount of ants, amount of nodes, size of screen and many more things)
  this is actually a rather fun algoritm to watch
  To be honest, not the best tho
  Realistically, I am dissapointed by this alg

Opt optimizings https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-opt
- it is really sad that this is the best thing you can do, no ammount of fancy algorithms work as well as this. Perhaps there are special cases as I do not have real life data but god damn, this is much better and much simpler than anything else

for 40 items, it seems that 40, 1 - 1.5, 2, 0.01, 100 works really well
